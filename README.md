#### What Opeity Is
Opeity is a lightweight(ish) simple web browser based on [Awesomium](www.awesomium.com). Its purpose is to be a modern browser 
in situations where a full featured browser is not feasable such as under low memory conditions.

#### What Opeity Is Not
Opeity is not meant to replace full featured, robust desktop web browsers such as [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). Opeity's functionality 
is intentionally limited to increase speed and decrease file size. We plan on keeping a relitively small and semi-clean code 
base throughout the projects life cycle.

#### Building Opeity
Opeity is developed using [Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx) 
on Windows 8.1 with .NET 4.5 and Nuget Package Restore is enabled to make things easier for other developers. Please feel free to 
contribute to Opeity via Github.
